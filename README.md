# Auto-send-email
This Python script uses the smtplib library to send emails via Gmail's SMTP server. It logs into a Gmail account using an app-specific password, composes an email with a subject and body, and sends it to a list of recipients. The script handles the connection setup, authentication, email composition, and sending processes.
